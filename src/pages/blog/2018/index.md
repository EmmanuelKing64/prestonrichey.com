<section class="blog-section">

At the end of 2017, <a href="https://prestonrichey.com/blog/2017/">I wrote</a> about some of my favorite things that happened that year. While the exercise of distilling a year down into a few paragraphs is an exhausting one for me, I enjoy both doing it and having done it, so this is my attempt at summing up last year. I called 2017 "exhausting and edifying"; I could say the same of 2018 (and, in retrospect, probably any good year), but I'd add, more simply: coalescing.

I started 2018 in Kansas City, working as Creative Technologist of <a href="https://www.barkleyus.com/">Barkley</a>'s (now defunct) innovation lab, <a href="https://medium.com/moonshotlab">Moonshot</a>. There, I had the privilege of learning how to use new and emerging technologies to solve novel problems. In January, we finished <a href="https://medium.com/moonshotlab/marco-polo-58201c14c669">Marco Polo</a>, a comprehensive exhibit showcasing conversational technology. Being the only developer on the team taught me to learn quickly and solve problems by myself, but it soon became evident that to continue my development as a developer, I needed to work more closely with other developers more senior to myself. I started looking for a new position where I would be challenged in different ways than at Barkley, and in March, I found it, at SelectQuote.

My tenure at <a href="https://www.selectquote.com/">SelectQuote</a> was relatively short, but during my time there I was surrounded by a team of incredibly sharp engineers. I worked, for the first time, on substantial enterprise applications written with <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> (üòç) and benefitted from a strong culture of code review and pair programming. I learned a ton, but I knew my role there would only go so far in getting me closer to a job in New York, a goal I had had ever since visiting the city for the first time <a href="https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipMeUHAdXIR_e7hvGZQdmsoEqBFVhTvOH2uQ_XTlySEKz0S5tpXBmkTe_kLwo9IshA/photo/AF1QipMppKCMCiUhL3F94uRlFfY61ZNSAVxpRsQPtTsK?key=b2pyT3RtU0NvaHo2M1lIUkp1RW9hellKYnlnMXJB">at age 13</a>. That's why, when I finally heard back from <a href="https://postlight.com/">Postlight</a>, a digital product studio based in Manhattan, I knew my time in the Midwest was, after 26 years, coming to an end. (And I couldn't have been more excited!)

I couldn'h have been more excited to start at Postlight at the end of June.
