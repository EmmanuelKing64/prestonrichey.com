Somehow, I got paid to make a Twitterbot (thanks <a href="http://moonshot.barkleyus.com" target="_blank"> Moonshot</a>!).

In 2016, <a href="https://www.barkleyus.com/" target="_blank">Barkley</a> underwent major renovations on the 4th floor of the old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TWA_Corporate_Headquarters_Building" target="_blank">TWA headquarters</a> it calls home. The space, formerly consisting mostly of client-specific 'war-rooms', was opened up as a collaboration space for all partners. It included an expanded company kitchen and lunch area, as well as two 'zen rooms', light- and sound-proof rooms no more than 6 feet on a side, for partners to use for work, sleep, or (ostensibly) meditation.

The rooms were great in practice, but it was endlessly frustrating to make the trek up from the 2nd or 3rd floor only to find both rooms occupied (evidenced by a red bulb lit outside).
