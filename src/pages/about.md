## Howdy.

My name is Preston and I'm a developer living in Kansas City. Currently, I work as the Creative Technologist at <a href="https://www.barkleyus.com/" target="_blank">Barkley</a>. I'm passionate about solving problems, using strong passwords, and pho.

In my free time, I enjoy cycling and listening to jazz.
